# Tricks in PyCharm

1. Ctrl + click is a useful operation in PyCharm that allows you to navigate to a specific class or function declaration. By placing the cursor on a class or function name and pressing Ctrl + click, PyCharm will take you to the corresponding definition or implementation, providing more detailed information about that particular element. This feature helps you explore the source code and gain a better understanding of how classes and functions are implemented, facilitating efficient code navigation and comprehension.
2. Ctrl + p is a keyboard shortcut in PyCharm that displays parameter hints. When you're working with a function or method and you press Ctrl + P, PyCharm will show you the parameter information for that specific function or method. This feature is beneficial when you want to quickly reference the expected arguments and their types, helping you write code accurately and ensuring that the correct parameters are passed to the function or method. It assists in improving code quality and reducing potential errors.
3. Alt + enter. In PyCharm, the function of the operation Alt + Enter is to access the quick-fix menu. This keyboard shortcut is a powerful feature that helps you identify and fix issues or improve your code by providing suggestions and options. When you place the cursor on a highlighted code section or encounter a warning or error, pressing Alt + Enter (or Option + Enter on macOS) triggers the quick-fix menu. The menu presents a list of potential actions or suggestions to resolve the issue or improve the code.
